# RunCMD

RunCMD is a standalone command/terminal shell. This may be useful in places where:

  - cmd.exe is restricted
  - copy text from command prompt

### Limitations
As of now there are following limitations. Feel free to do any feature request:
* The output is seen only when the command has finished executing.
* Shell like look and feel is missing.
